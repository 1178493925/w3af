## Install the software

The ysoserial.net application only works in windows + visual studio.

You will have to install Windows, Visual Studio, and then get the
tool from: `git clone https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net.git`

After building the tool you'll get a `ysoserial.exe`, now you're
ready to create some payloads.
